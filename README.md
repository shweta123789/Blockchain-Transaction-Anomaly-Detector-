ðŸ§  Algorithms Used
Isolation Forest:
Isolation Forest is an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm that works by randomly selecting features and splitting data points to isolate them. Since anomalies are few and different, they are easier to isolate and require fewer splits compared to normal data points. This property makes Isolation Forest efficient, scalable, and well-suited for detecting outliers in large, high-dimensional datasets such as blockchain transaction records.
